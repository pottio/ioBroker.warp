## WARP charger adapter for ioBroker

This adapter monitors and controls a wallbox [(WARP charger)](https://www.warp-charger.com/) by [Tinkerforge](https://www.tinkerforge.com/de/) via ioBroker. The connection will be established via WebSockets.

#### Only WARP firmware versions >= 2.0.0 are supported since adapter version 1.0.0

Why using this adapter - it is also possible to connect the wallbox to ioBroker via MQTT ?! 

However, no individual states are sent via MQTT, but complex JSON objects. The warp adapter resolves the complex JSON objects into single states. This makes it easier to react on value changes of a single state. In addition, each state is provided with the corresponding description, unit and further information, which can be found in the [official API documentation](https://www.warp-charger.com/api.html). To top it off some commands like starting/stopping charging, setting upper limits of allowed charging current, resetting meter readings, scanning nearby WLAN networks and customizing the display name are possible. The change of all system parameters, such as network configuration, MQTT settings, user administration or load manager, are only possible via the web interface for security reasons.
